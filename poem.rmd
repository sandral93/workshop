He was so proud of his little girl.  
It was her very first day of school.  
He walked with her to school that day,  
And she held his hand all the way.  
They walked together quiet and sad,  
A little girl and her loving dad.  
Into the school her father led,  
But he almost cried when she said,  
"Daddy, Daddy, please don't go.  
Don't leave me here all alone.  
I'll miss you if you go away,
And I might need you; can't you stay?"  
"Little Daughter, please don't cry.  
You'll be okay, so dry your eyes.  
You have our memories in your heart.  
We're together though we're apart."  

He sat up front on her wedding day  
And cried as his daughter walked away.  
Later that night he watched her dance.  
He sat there waiting for his chance.
